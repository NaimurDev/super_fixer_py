Steps:
Download bulk images from Canva
They will be divided into 10 folders cause each Canva project can hold upto 500 slides.
Each folder starts from 1-500 but because we want to merge them into one folder we need to use renamer.py to make 2nd folder files start from 501
Then again we need to make folders for each group of style so we run group_maker.py
Lastly generate all with generator.py

Optional:
	You can use image enhancers.
